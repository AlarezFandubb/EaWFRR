### Ideas ###

 SIC_dead_monarchy:0 "A Dead Monarchy"
 SIC_dead_monarchy_desc:0 "Monarchy? What monarchy? There hasn’t been a rightful heir to the throne of Sicameon in decades! The council greedily holds onto the power they’ve been given; only now realising that they won’t be able to keep it forever. Perhaps they’ll finally be willing to elect a new griff to the throne. Perhaps they won’t get a chance."
 SIC_republican_tension:0 "Republican Tension"
 SIC_republican_tension_desc:0 "Despite the best efforts of the council, or worst if you choose to be cynical, the republican factions within Sicameon remain powerful and prepared. They are loudly and proudly entrenched within civilian centres, unafraid to show themselves and protest; something that consistently makes the control of the regency seem less likely to stay by the week."

 SIC_swordfish_claws:0 "The Swordfish's claws"
 SIC_swordfish_claws_desc:0 "The problem with having such a potent navy is that when someone who hates the government gets in control of some of it, things go south. This quite succinctly explains why complex machinery and massive numbers of workers keep going missing whenever the Don arrives in port now that he’s been discharged from service. Unfortunately, he’s just as popular as he is influential and thus far the government has not been able to clamp down."

 SIC_eternal_navy_desc:0 "Despite the problems in its management, the navy as a whole is something that everygriff in Sicameon is proud of. The discipline and strength of the fleet is unmatched, or at least it shall be once the country is back walking on four legs! All shall fear the might of our perfect ships, except perhaps the Don; so long as his bribes keep coming in of course."

 sicameon.166.t:0 "Time is Running Out"
 sicameon.166.d:0 "The years have been cruel to Sicameon and to its rulers. In the past few decades, many elusive problems have begun to rear their ugly heads, posing a challenge to the ruling Regency Council and the nation that hosts it.\n\nFirstly, piracy and illegal trade have strained our economy and caused corruption to fester throughout local governments. An ever-growing number of upstart politicians line their own pockets with bribe money while the average citizen lives in fear of going outside at night.\n\nTo add to this, the popularity of our ruling Regency Council, having previously been uneasy, has recently begun to decay at an alarming rate. Republican parties have captured the hearts of a concerning swathe of the population, which looks increasingly towards revolution due to the uncompromising nature of our rule. The indecisiveness of the Regency Council towards electing a monarch does little to recover the government’s reputation, either.\n\nWe are left with two different possible approaches. The Regency Council should either focus all of its efforts on suppressing dissent or electing a monarch. Although getting a king on the throne may yet prove itself an indomitable task given the situation, it would solve some of our more immediate problems and help get the nation back on the right track. That said, facing our enemies head on would likely prove a less difficult but more risky effort. The choice ultimately falls to the Regency Council, which, in a rare moment of unity, decides…"
